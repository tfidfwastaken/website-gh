(definitely not edited to make myself look better)

> Atharva has an odd sense of humour and the curiosity of a five-year old. He is moderately easy to talk to and will most definitely *appear* like he knows everything about everything.

### What I'm listening to these days

- Sevdaliza – Shabrang
- Charli XCX – how i'm feeling now

### What I'm reading now

- Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, (Abelson, (* 2 Sussman))  
SICP is a renowned book that teaches program design through Scheme.

- The Design of Everyday Things, Donald Norman  
A really nice book that talks about everyday design. Goes into human psychology as well as design processes for making human friendly things. I haven't touched this in a while but I intend to finish it so I am leaving this here.
