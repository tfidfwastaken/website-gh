I'm not that good at describing myself so I let a friend who cannot draw Santa Claus do it:

(definitely not edited to make myself look better)

> Atharva has an odd sense of humour and the curiosity of a five-year old. He is moderately easy to talk to and will most definitely *appear* like he knows everything about everything.

I got a free server, a free domain, and a lot of free time, and that's why you are seeing this.

### What I'm listening to these days

- Backxwash - God Has Nothing To Do With This Leave Him Out Of It

A dark, abrasive and aggresive record with odd sampling choices (and sometimes wonderfully harsh guitars) tied together with Backxwash's intense delivery. Some of the most progressive and fantastic music I have heard all year.

- Portishead - Dummy

A trip hop classic that I recently discovered. The grimy ambient sounds and trashy drum loops juxtaposed with the lead singer's strong but serene vocals make for an amazing aesthetic.

- RTJ4 - Run The Jewels

Great tracks, great rapping, great chemistry, a timely (albeit mostly for America) message on really solid well produced beats that *slap*. And yet, like with all other Run The Jewels projects, I won't be going back to this ever for the most part. Doesn't really click with me.

- The New Abnormal- The Strokes

The Strokes give that magical nostalgic sound of guitars and synths with Julian Casablanca's emotionally potent delivery, that make for a really solid album. Probably my favourite this year so far.

### What I'm reading now

- Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, (Abelson, (* 2 Sussman))

SICP is a renowned book that teaches program design through Scheme.

- The Design of Everyday Things, Donald Norman

A really nice book that talks about everyday design. Goes into human psychology as well as design processes for making human friendly things. I haven't touched this in a while but I intend to finish it so I am leaving this here.
