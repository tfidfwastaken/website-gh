"The malls are soon to be ghost towns", sings Isaac Brock on one of my favourite songs of Modest Mouse's The Lonesome Crowded West.

Seems pretty literal now thanks to the pandemic.

Malls never went away when he said that, but there is in my opinion an undeniable emptiness created by an emphasis of shallow consumerism and a lack of authenticity in these huge complexes. This "mall phenomenon" isn't just a mall thing. In the internet world small amateurish and homebrew websites and blogs declined in favour of large centralized hubs and walled gardens.

Google, Facebook and Amazon are the malls of the internet characterized by that same vague emptiness and lack of authenticity. Something about optimizing to make the most money ruins the fun I guess.

Mailing lists need to die already. I know many big projects rely on them historically and maybe find it hard to migrate all discussions. That makes me dislike them no less. Poor searchability and readability. Floods my inbox. Not fun.

I'm aware that there are ways to configure it and add workarounds to make them manageable, but I much prefer a good out of the box experience for things like these.

I don't know. Leave me alone actually.
