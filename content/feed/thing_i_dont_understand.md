Add this to my expanding list of things I don't understand: why is it _so_ hard to take feedback?

Whenever I create a friendly anonymous form which takes about 20ish seconds to fill, very few respond to it, and those who do will rate your thing something like a 7/10 will then say in the feedback comment something along the lines of “It was fine”, “No improvement needed” etc.
