My heuristic for figuring out whether I should say anything online:

- Has anyone said it more eloquently?
- Does it say/reveal something sufficiently new for most of the readers that will come across it? [^1]
- Is my perspective on this is sufficiently unique and dictated by my experience?

And this is why I don't have much writing online. Most of my ideas cannot percolate down those three questions.

[^1]: Don't have to worry about being new for the readers when there are no readers, amirite
